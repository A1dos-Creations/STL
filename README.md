# 🚀[STL] School Tool Launcher ✨
<P>This is the official github for School Tool Launcher. Here you will find the source code for the extension. 
As new updates roll out, this github will be updated. </P>  

> We are aware of the glitch with the Aeries portal button. We are currently working on a fix that does not require the re-evaluation of STL.

# 📑Information
> Whats STL?
STL is an abreviation of 'School Tool Launcher'. This extension simplifies the school day by allowing students to access necesary resources with the click of a button.

For schools or educational organizations, please read the [Notice.](./NOTICE.md)

What are it's benefits?
STL allows students to access required and necesary school resuources quickly to ensure a smooth learning experience with as little destractions as possible.  

# 🧾About
Take control of your academic life with this game-changing Chrome extension. Effortlessly access your school portals, organize assignments with custom tasks, and add personalized portals for quick, easy access to the resources you need. Built with students in mind, it’s designed to simplify your daily routine and keep you ahead of the curve.

# 🌀 What's next?
I am planning on adding a link to Google's Calendar and Google Classroom for more dynamic tasks and task integration with Google Calendar. This will use a thrid party service named "Clerk". Signing in with google will be optional, but required for certain features. I am also planning on adding more features such as reminders for tasks that show in-line with the website you're on. I am also hoping to add dynamic external connection to my website A1dos-Creations.com to update the discover page without the hassle of getting the extension re-evaluated. More updates will be availible later in the month! Thank you for your interest in STL! ❤️
