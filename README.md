# 🚀[STL] School Tool Launcher ✨
This is the official github for School Tool Launcher. Here you will find the source code for the extension. 
As new updates roll out, this github will be updated. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**NOTICE TO ALL CCUSD STUDENTS**: We are aware that most CCUSD (Culver City Unified School District) students cannot properly use most features of STL. This is because CCUSD computers cannot use or run JavaScript on Google Chrome. This disables all background service workers that allow features such as tasks and timers to work properly. We apologize for the inconvinience and are working on the issue. _This issue may take several weeks to resolve._

We don't collect any revenue from STL or A1dos Creations, and keeping the upcoming accounts feature's databases up and running costs money! 
Please consider donating $1, it helps a ton, and your generosity is deeply appreciated! 💖

# 🧾About
Take control of your academic life with this game-changing Chrome extension. Effortlessly access your school portals, organize assignments with custom tasks, and add personalized portals for quick, easy access to the resources you need. Built with students in mind, it’s designed to simplify your daily routine and keep you ahead of the curve.

# 🌀 What's next?
I am planning on adding a link to Google's Calendar and Google Classroom for more dynamic tasks and task integration with Google Calendar. This will use a thrid party service named "Clerk". Signing in with google will be optional, but required for certain features. I am also planning on adding more features such as reminders for tasks that show in-line with the website you're on. I am also hoping to add dynamic external connection to my website A1dos-Creations.com to update the discover page without the hassle of getting the extension re-evaluated. More updates will be availible later in the month! Thank you for your interest in STL! ❤️

- A1dos, 2/4/25

We are currently in the process of rolling out (A1dos Creations) accounts! Soon you will be able to create an account with A1dos!
